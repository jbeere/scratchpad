LIGHT METER
-----------

You need:

- 1x Teensy
- 1x Solderless Breadboard
- 1x 10k light dependent resistor (RS components part 455-8036)
- 10x 1k resistors (or a 10k resistor if you have one)
- Mac OSX or Debian Linux
- Free USB port

Set up your circuit as follows:

vcc ═══▼═╦═⌂══ gnd
         ║
         f1

▼  = light dependent resistor
⌂  = 10k resistor
f1 = analog pin on the Teensy

Before doing the following try these from a command prompt:

prompt> irb
irb prompt> require 'rubygems'
irb prompt> require 'serialport'
irb prompt> require 'tk'
irb prompt> quit

If one of the above does not work, you will have to do one or more of the
following:

-- for OSX, you must make sure you have the latest XCode installed, it's
on the Snow Leopard disc
-- for OSX, you need to have Ruby built with TK, here is a nice tutorial
to do that http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html (Do not use that
One-Click-Installer it's rubbish, took me 3 days to undo the damage it did)
-- you need to have rubygems installed, and the 'serialport' gem

You need the newest XCode, because the old one compiles in 32 bit, and it
doesn't work too well in Snow Leopard, I learned that the hard way.
If you did any of these before installing Snow Leopard, you need to redo,
because the old 32 bit stuff won't work!
TK is for displaying graphics from Ruby
The 'serialport' gem is a super cool gem that allows for easy serial IO,
it is also the reason I went the Ruby route.

Once all that works, brilliant, unzip the attached zip file, go to the
directory in a terminal prompt


promtp> make 


Use the Teensy loader app to copy the generated lightmeter.hex file on to
your Teensy, press the button on the Teensy to reboot it


prompt> ruby graph.rb 


If you get a device not configured error or something, then you need to
find out which tty device (/dev/tty?????) is your teensym and change it in
the graph.rb file, and try again.

You should get a visual display of the reading on the light meter.
Congrats.

Read the comments in the lightmeter.c and graph.rb files to see what is
going on, I tried to keep it readable, and commented as much as possible.
You can ask me any question about it and I will do my best to answer you.
